"""Contract-tier smoke test.

Contract tests pin the shape of an external boundary this project depends on or
provides -- the request/response schema an upstream API promises, or the payload
a downstream consumer expects. They guard against silent drift when that
boundary changes, without requiring the live service (unlike integration tests).

This placeholder keeps the tier non-empty; replace it with a real
provider/consumer contract check (e.g. validate a recorded sample against your
schema).
